## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Open Docker and Install rabbitMQ instance.
     **Note**: If you have already running an instace, you can skip this step.
     ```bash
     docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
     ```    

3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/elizabethG9/access-service.git
     ```

4. Navigate to the root folder.
     ```bash
     cd access-service
     ```
   
5. Inside the folder access-service create a file and call it .env then fill with the following example values.
      ```bash
    DB_HOST=dpg-ctd34bhu0jms73f1tqcg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=access_service
    DB_USER=access_service_user
    DB_PASSWORD=5ZwHFCBNhc1G8DwVPaqSupqdfKbLmWEQ

    JWT_SECRET=59jcjsoxfjaopcva√±AODKjo389sjfiKDH
      ```
    
6. Install project dependencies using dotnet sdk.
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```
7. Run project.
      ```bash
      dotnet run
